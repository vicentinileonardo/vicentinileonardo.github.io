My interests include **cloud computing**, **distributed systems**, **AI systems** , **IT infrastructure**, and **software engineering** in general.

I hold a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science** from the **University of Trento**, Italy.

In 2024, I did an internship at the [**European Space Agency**](https://www.esa.int/), as a **Software Engineer (Cloud & Infrastructure)**. In particular, I worked in the Mission Operations Infrastructure IT section at the [**European Space Operations Centre (ESOC)**](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany.

In 2025, I graduated with a **Master's degree in Computer Science** from the **University of Trento**, Italy with a theses titled: **"A Policy-Driven Kubernetes-based Architecture for Resource Management in Multi-Cloud Environments"** developed in collaboration with [**Krateo PlatformOps**](https://krateo.io/).

Currently, I’m a Software Engineer at [**Krateo PlatformOps**](https://krateo.io/), where I focus on:
- developing a [generator for multi-controller Kubernetes Operators](https://github.com/krateoplatformops/oasgen-provider)
- integrating diverse services into cloud-native environments
- designing AI agents architectures within Kubernetes environments
- experimenting with distributed inference systems on Kubernetes.

I truly believe in continuous learning and self-improvement, and I’m always digging into new technologies and paradigms.
The world of Computer Science is vast and ever-evolving, and among other things, I love the fact that there is not a single day where you don't learn something new or understand a concept better than before.

*Learning is the only thing the mind never exhausts, never fears, and never regrets.*
