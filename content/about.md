My interests include **cloud computing**, **distributed systems**, **IT Infrastructure**, **data engineering**, and **software engineering** in general.

I recently completed an internship at the [**European Space Agency**](https://www.esa.int/), as a **Software Engineer (Cloud & Infrastructure)**. In particular, I worked in the Mission Operations Infrastructure IT section at the [**European Space Operations Centre (ESOC)**](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany.

I just graduated with a **Master's degree in Computer Science** from the **University of Trento**, Italy with a theses titled: **A Policy-Driven Kubernetes-based Architecture for Resource Management in Multi-Cloud Environments**.
