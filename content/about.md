My research interests include **distributed systems**, **cloud computing**, **IT Infrastructure**, **data engineering**, and **software engineering** in general.

Currently doing an internship at the [**European Space Agency**](https://www.esa.int/), as a **Software Engineer (Cloud & Infrastructure)**. In particular, I am working in the Mission Operations Infrastructure IT section at the [**European Space Operations Centre (ESOC)**](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany.
