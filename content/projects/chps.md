# Convex Hull Problem Solver

10/2022 - 12/2022

## Project description

Parallel implementation of the Divide and Conquer algorithm for the convex hull problem. 

The implementation is based on the C programming language and leverages **MPI** and **OpenMP** libraries. The solution was tested on a **High-Performance Computing cluster** with specific PBS configuration files.

## Team and role

Team size: 2 people

+ The team designed the general implementation strategy together. <br>
+ I contributed in part of the core implementation and debugging of the algorithm. <br>
+ I was responsible for the implementation fo the *OpenMP* section of the project. <br>
+ I investigated various PBS configurations for the HPC cluster and proposed the final one. <br>
